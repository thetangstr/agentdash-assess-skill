name: assess-agentic
description: Assess an organization for agentic workflow readiness
level: 3
---

<Purpose>
Assess an organization for its readiness to design and sustain an agentic workflow with closed-loop support. Collect the minimum necessary intake (company name, URL, assessment type), then hand off to the deep-interview skill for adaptive Socratic requirements gathering — framed specifically for agentic workflow design. The output is a crystallized spec ready for execution.
</Purpose>

<Use_When>
- User wants to assess whether their organization is ready for AI agent workflows
- User says "assess our readiness", "agentic workflow assessment", "evaluate us for AI agents", "can we do agents here"
- User wants a project-level or company-level readiness assessment before committing to building
- User wants a closed-loop agentic system (autonomous execution + monitoring + feedback + adaptation)
</Use_When>

<Do_Not_Use_When>
- User already has a detailed PRD or spec file — use the appropriate planning or execution skill directly instead of this assessment workflow
- User wants competitive intelligence or market research — this is readiness assessment, not market analysis
- User wants a quick one-question answer — use a direct answer instead
</Do_Not_Use_When>

<Why_This_Exists>
Most agentic workflow failures don't stem from technology — they stem from unclear requirements: nobody defined what "success" means, nobody named the systems that need to integrate, nobody established error tolerance or escalation paths. This skill applies mathematical clarity gates (via deep-interview) before any execution begins, specifically for the closed-loop agentic workflow domain.
</Why_This_Exists>

<Execution_Policy>
- Collect intake FIRST, then hand off to deep-interview — do not skip intake
- Use the company URL to fetch and summarize the website before seeding deep-interview
- Frame the deep-interview with domain-specific seed context: closed-loop agentic workflow, sustainability, error tolerance
- Use `--standard` deep-interview depth for most assessments
- After deep-interview crystallizes, format the spec as a structured markdown report
- Treat `pandoc` as a required dependency because DOCX is the final deliverable
- Use the consultant frameworks (knowledge.md) to inform interview framing
- Use the report templates (strategy.md) to structure the output
</Execution_Policy>

<Steps>

## Phase 0: Self-install + runtime check

This skill can bootstrap itself. Before starting, check if the skill is installed, and install it if missing, then detect the user's active agent runtime.

### 0a: Self-install (if needed)

Check for an installed copy in the host-specific skill directory:
- Claude Code / OMC: `~/skills/assess-agentic/SKILL.md` or `~/.claude/skills/assess-agentic/SKILL.md`
- Codex / OMX: `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/assess-agentic/SKILL.md`

If missing, install for the active host:

**Claude Code / OMC host:**
1. Create the skills directory: `Bash: mkdir -p ~/skills`
2. Clone the repo: `Bash: git clone https://github.com/thetangstr/agentdash-assess-skill.git ~/skills/assess-agentic`
3. Add the import to CLAUDE.md if not already present (check if `~/skills/assess-agentic/SKILL.md` appears in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
4. If CLAUDE.md doesn't have the import yet, append the import line to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` using `Bash: echo '\n@import ~/skills/assess-agentic/SKILL.md' >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
5. Tell the user: "Skill installed. Please run `/assess-agentic` again."

**Codex / OMX host:**
1. Create the skills directory: `Bash: mkdir -p "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills"`
2. Clone the repo: `Bash: git clone https://github.com/thetangstr/agentdash-assess-skill.git "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/assess-agentic"`
3. Tell the user: "Skill installed. Restart Codex, then ask for `assess-agentic` again."

### 0b: Runtime detection and pre-flight check

**This is a hard gate. There is no limited mode. Either the deep-interview skill is available through the runtime the user is actually using (OMC for Claude Code, OMX for Codex), or the skill stops.**

Runtime choice is based on the active host, not simply on which binaries are installed. Many machines have both `claude` and `codex`; do not choose OMC just because `claude` exists, and do not choose OMX just because `codex` exists.

**Step 1 — Detect the active host and matching workflow layer:**

Collect these signals:
```
claude --version 2>/dev/null | head -1
codex --version 2>/dev/null | head -1
omc --version 2>/dev/null | head -1
omx --version 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

Then select the runtime:
- If the current agent host is **Claude Code** or the `Skill(...)` tool is available → select **OMC**.
- If the current agent host is **Codex** or the user invoked this from an OMX-managed Codex session → select **OMX**.
- If both hosts are installed but the active host is ambiguous, ask one concise question: "Are you running this assessment in Claude Code/OMC or Codex/OMX?"
- If neither matching workflow layer is installed for the active host, offer to install that layer only.

After selection, set these variables and use them for every later phase:
- `runtime_name`: `OMC` or `OMX`
- `runtime_host`: `Claude Code` or `Codex`
- `runtime_output_dir`: `.omc/specs` for OMC, `.omx/specs` for OMX
- `deep_interview_invocation`: OMC uses `Skill("oh-my-claudecode:deep-interview", ...)`; OMX uses the Codex in-session skill surface `$deep-interview "..."`

**Step 2 — Check if deep-interview is available:**

For selected **OMC (Claude Code)**:
```
Skill("oh-my-claudecode:deep-interview", "--help")
```

For selected **OMX (Codex)**:
```
omx --version
omx doctor
```
Then verify the in-session skill surface is available before handoff. In Codex, `$deep-interview` is an OMX skill invocation typed into the agent session, not a Bash executable. Do not run `$deep-interview` through Bash unless the local OMX version explicitly exposes it as a command.

If the selected runtime's deep-interview path is available, skip to Phase 1.

**Step 3 — If deep-interview is NOT available, offer install:**

**For selected OMC:**
```
"This skill requires OMC (oh-my-claudecode) with the deep-interview skill. It is not currently installed on this machine. May I install it now?

[Install OMC] [Cancel and exit]"
```

- **Cancel and exit**: Say "Understood. Run `/assess-agentic` after OMC is installed." then stop. Do not collect intake. Do not offer limited mode.
- **Install OMC**: run:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oh-my-claude/oh-my-claude/main/install.sh | bash
  ```
  Wait for it to finish. Then run:
  ```bash
  omc setup
  ```
  Wait for that to finish.

**For selected OMX:**
```
"This skill requires OMX (oh-my-codex) with the deep-interview skill. It is not currently installed on this machine. May I install it now?

[Install OMX] [Cancel and exit]"
```

- **Cancel and exit**: Say "Understood. Run `/assess-agentic` after OMX is installed." then stop.
- **Install OMX**: run:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @openai/codex oh-my-codex
  ```
  Wait for it to finish. Then run:
  ```bash
  omx setup
  omx doctor
  ```
  Wait for that to finish.

**Step 4 — Verify again:**

OMC: `Skill("oh-my-claudecode:deep-interview", "--help")`
OMX: `omx doctor`, then confirm `$deep-interview` is available as a Codex/OMX in-session skill.

If deep-interview is still unavailable after install, report the error and stop. Do not offer limited mode.

**There is no limited mode. There is no manual fallback. If deep-interview is unavailable, the skill stops.**

### 0c: DOCX export dependency check

**`pandoc` is required.** The final deliverable is a DOCX file, so do not collect intake until DOCX export is possible.

Check for pandoc:
```bash
pandoc --version 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

If pandoc is available, continue to Phase 1.

If pandoc is missing, offer to install it before continuing:

**macOS with Homebrew available:**
```bash
brew install pandoc
```

**Debian/Ubuntu Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y pandoc
```

**Other environments:** direct the user to install pandoc from https://pandoc.org/installing.html, then rerun `/assess-agentic`.

After installation, verify again:
```bash
pandoc --version 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

If pandoc is still unavailable, stop and say: "Pandoc is required to export the DOCX deliverable. Install pandoc, then rerun `/assess-agentic`." Do not proceed with markdown-only output.

Proceed to Phase 1 only after deep-interview and pandoc are both confirmed available.

## Phase 1: Intake

Collect these fields from the user using `AskUserQuestion`:

1. **Company name** — "What organization are we assessing?"
2. **Company website URL** — "What's their primary website URL?" (used for research fetch)
3. **Assessment type** — `company` (full organization readiness) or `project` (single workflow assessment)
4. **If project**: Project name + one-line description of the workflow

Present them as a concise intake form, not a raw Q&A.

## Phase 2: Research

Fetch the company website at the provided URL:
- Use `WebFetch` or a bash `curl` call to retrieve the HTML
- Strip HTML to plain text (first ~3000 characters is sufficient)
- Detect the primary industry/sector from the content via keyword matching
- Produce a one-paragraph company summary

If the URL is unreachable or empty, note it and proceed with the company name only.

## Phase 2b: Pre-Interview Pulse

Before handing off to the deep Socratic interview, establish the business context that keeps the entire engagement grounded. These questions are NOT answered by the consultant — they are answered by the client. Present them as a compact intake form, not a raw Q&A.

**Business goal questions:**

1. **"What business problem are we solving?"**
   *(What is the actual pain — not the IT symptom, but the business impact? Who is affected and how?)*

2. **"What business outcome do you want?"**
   *(Describe success in business terms — revenue gained, cost reduced, time saved, errors prevented. Not "we want AI agents". What does winning look like?)*

3. **"What does doing nothing cost you?"**
   *(What is the ongoing cost of the current problem? Hours lost per week? Revenue leaking? Customers churning? Being beaten by competitors?)*

4. **"Who is the decision maker and DRI for this project?"**
   *(Who will sign off? Who will run it day-to-day? Without named accountable people, the project will stall.)*

5. **"What is the timeline pressure?"**
   *(Is there a hard deadline? A trade show, board meeting, or product launch driving this? Or is this exploratory?)*

6. **"What is the budget envelope for the pilot?"**
   *(Rough range is fine — $5K, $50K, $500K? This shapes whether we recommend build vs. buy vs. hybridize.)*

**Additional context questions:**

7. **"What systems does this workflow touch today?"**
   *(Name the actual systems — Salesforce, SAP, SharePoint, Slack, etc. Don't worry about correctness, just name what comes to mind.)*

8. **"What is the approximate size of your organization?"**
   *(Number of employees, revenue range, or industry — helps calibrate the scale of the solution.)*

Collect all answers and inject them into the Phase 3 seed prompt. The deep-interview should never re-ask these — it builds on them.

## Phase 2c: Domain & Competitive Research

**This phase is mandatory. Do not skip it.**

Before seeding the deep interview, the consultant must research the domain, industry, and competitive landscape. This research:
- Informs the interview questions with current market context
- Surfaces comparable solutions the client may not know about
- Identifies industry-specific AI adoption patterns and blockers
- Reveals competitive pressure that may drive urgency

### For Project-Level Assessments: Domain Technology Research

Research the latest solutions for the specific domain. Use `WebSearch` to find current state-of-the-art.

**Research scope per domain type:**

| If the project involves... | Research these questions |
|---|---|
| Knowledge base / document management | What are the leading knowledge management platforms? What AI features do Notion, Confluence, SharePoint, Guru, Atlas offers? How are enterprises doing RAG over enterprise corpora? |
| Customer support / service desk | What AI agent solutions exist for Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom? What deflection rates do leading solutions achieve? |
| CRM / sales automation | What's the state of AI agents for Salesforce, HubSpot? How does AI CRM data entry work? What's the ROI data? |
| Data analysis / BI | What are the leading AI analytics agents? How does Microsoft's Copilot for Analytics compare to custom solutions? |
| Document / contract processing | What are the leading document AI platforms? How do Kira Systems, Leverton, Luminance compare? |
| Code generation / code review | What's the current state of AI coding agents — Codex, Cursor, Copilot Workspace? What do development teams report as productivity gains? |
| HR / recruiting | What AI agents exist for resume screening, interview scheduling, onboarding? |
| Finance / accounting | What AI agents exist for AP automation, reconciliation, audit? What about Moody's, Bloomberg AI? |

**Search format:**
```
WebSearch: "{domain} AI agent solution 2026 enterprise" + WebSearch: "{specific tool} AI features comparison"
```

### For Company-Level Assessments: Industry & Competitive Research

Research the industry context using `WebSearch` and `WebFetch`.

**Research scope:**

1. **Industry context** — What are the major trends? Who are the key players? What does the competitive landscape look like?
2. **AI adoption benchmarks** — What are companies in this industry reporting for AI agent adoption? What ROI data exists?
3. **Peer examples** — Find 2-3 public case studies of AI agent projects in this industry
4. **Regulatory environment** — Any industry-specific regulations affecting AI agent deployment?
5. **Regional factors** — If multi-region, note relevant regional differences in AI adoption

**Search format:**
```
WebSearch: "{industry} AI agent adoption trends 2026"
WebSearch: "{industry} AI automation case study"
WebSearch: "{industry} AI ROI statistics"
```

### Research Output

After research, produce a **Domain Brief** (2-3 sentences) and **Competitive Landscape** (bulleted list) that you inject into the Phase 3 seed prompt.

```
**Domain Research:**
- Domain Brief: {2-3 sentence summary of current state-of-the-art}
- Competitive Landscape:
  - {Vendor/Platform}: {key AI features}, {approximate pricing}, {notable customers}
  - {Vendor/Platform}: ...
- Industry Benchmarks: {2-3 specific statistics or findings}
- Comparable Case Studies: {1-2 public examples with outcomes if available}
```

**Important:** Do not spend more than 10 minutes on research. The goal is context for the interview, not an exhaustive analysis. Record what you found and note gaps the deep-interview should probe.

Inject the Domain Research output into the Phase 3 seed prompt. The deep-interview will use this context to ask informed questions about specific tools and comparable solutions.

## Phase 3: Seed deep-interview

Invoke the `deep-interview` skill with a domain-specific seed. This phase is critical — you must frame the deep-interview with the consultant's forward-deployed engineer persona and the closed-loop agentic workflow assessment framework.

### Consultant Persona (from knowledge.md)

You are a Senior Strategy Consultant at AgentDash Consulting — a forward-deployed strategy consultant in the Palantir / OpenAI Frontier Alliance mold. The model: deploy like a consulting firm, ship like a product company.

Your mission: Help businesses adopt AI agents into their workflows to close more business faster, reduce operational costs, and transition from legacy models to AI-native operating systems.

Your worldview: AI is not a productivity tool layered onto existing workflows — it is an entirely new capability layer. An AI agent is a digital employee that requires goals, budgets, an org chart, and an audit trail.

Tone: Authoritative, pragmatic, and highly analytical. Empathy for the difficulty of unwinding legacy systems balanced with absolute candor about the necessity of doing so. No corporate fluff.

### IT Problems Are Never the Goal — Always Dig Deeper

**This is the most important consulting discipline in the interview.**

Clients will say "we need to clean up our SharePoint" or "our knowledge base is a mess." Do NOT accept this as the problem. It is a symptom. Your job is to dig until you find the actual business goal.

**The interrogation ladder:**
1. Client says: "Our SharePoint is disorganized."
2. Ask: "What business outcome is that blocking? Who is harmed and how?"
3. Client says: "Our team can't find answers so they guess."
4. Ask: "What does a wrong guess cost you? How often does it happen?"
5. Client says: "It causes delays in our sales cycle, maybe 2 days per deal."
6. Ask: "How many deals per quarter? What's 2 days times that?"
7. NOW you have a dollar figure. THAT is the problem worth solving.

**The IT-layer trap:**
- "Clean up SharePoint" → WRONG framing
- "Build a knowledge agent" → still IT-framed
- "Reduce sales cycle delays caused by knowledge loss, saving $X per quarter" → RIGHT framing

**Interview rules:**
- Never accept an IT problem as the stated goal. "What business outcome does that support?"
- When a client describes a system problem, ask what decision or outcome it blocks
- Convert every IT complaint into: "[Action] causes [dollar/time cost] because [downstream effect]"
- The pilot scope should be defined by a business metric, not a system name

**Examples of IT-layer vs. business-layer:**

| IT-Layer framing (reject) | Business-Layer framing (correct) |
|---|---|
| "Organize our SharePoint" | "Sales team loses 3h/week searching for specs — costing $X in delayed deals" |
| "Build a RAG chatbot" | "Engineers make design errors because they can't find past decisions — each error costs $X" |
| "Automate our CRM data entry" | "CRM is 40% empty because reps skip it — costing us $X in upsell misses" |
| "Fix our ticket routing" | "Tier-1 tickets take 48h to escalate because routing is wrong — NPS is X points below target" |

### The Five Assessment Dimensions (weighted)

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| **specificity** | 30% | Is the customer's primary opportunity concrete? Specific function, specific workflow, specific input/output. |
| **systems** | 25% | Are the systems and data the agent must touch named? Are integrations, MCP-readiness, and data quality known? |
| **success** | 20% | How will the customer know it works? Specific metric, baseline, target. |
| **risk** | 15% | Error tolerance, regulatory load, approval cadence, audit needs. What happens when the agent is wrong? |
| **fit** | 10% | Pilot fit — timeline, budget envelope, who the DRI is, whether it's a skunk-works candidate. |

**Ambiguity = 1 − (specificity × 0.30 + systems × 0.25 + success × 0.20 + risk × 0.15 + fit × 0.10)**

### Closed-Loop Architecture Requirements

Every agentic workflow assessment must probe for the four closed-loop components:

1. **Outcome signal** — what gets measured after every agent run (cited-doc hit rate, deflection rate, win rate, accept rate, time-to-first-draft)
2. **Judge** — a model, rule set, or human reviewer that turns outcome into a reward signal
3. **Memory** — how the agent remembers what it tried, what worked, and what failed across sessions
4. **Update mechanism** — how the reward feeds back: prompt update, skill registry update, retrieval reranker tune, model swap

### Agent Tier Classification

Classify the target agentic workflow on this typology:

| Tier | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Q&A Bot | Static FAQ + RAG over a small curated corpus |
| 2 | Knowledge Agent | RAG over enterprise corpus (SharePoint, Confluence, Drive) with ACL hydration |
| 3 | Workflow Runner | Multi-step task execution with approval gates, reads + writes to systems |
| 4 | Review / QA Agent | Agent observes another system's output and judges it against a rule set |
| 5 | Autonomous Research / Decision Agent | Multi-day work, writes-back actions, spawns subagents, makes judgment calls |

**Tier-shortcut rejection rule:** If the customer is reaching for Tier 5 with zero agents in production, downgrade to Tier 2 or 3.

### Invoke deep-interview NOW

**This is a required step. Use `runtime_name` from Phase 0. Do not re-detect here.**

**For selected OMC (Claude Code):**
```
Skill("oh-my-claudecode:deep-interview", "--standard <company_name> agentic workflow readiness assessment")
```

**For selected OMX (Codex):**
```
$deep-interview "--standard <company_name> agentic workflow readiness assessment"
```

**Will silently fail — do NOT use:**
- `Skill("deep-interview", ...)` without the `oh-my-claudecode:` prefix
- `/deep-interview --standard ...` — this is user-level chat syntax, not valid inside a skill body
- Bash execution of `$deep-interview` in an OMX flow unless the installed OMX version explicitly documents a shell command; `$deep-interview` is normally a Codex in-session skill surface

The deep-interview skill will take over the conversation, run its Socratic loop, and return when the spec crystallizes. After it returns, proceed immediately to Phase 5.

**Scope:**
- Project-level assessment: `scope: "assess_project"`
- Company-level assessment: `scope: "cos_onboarding"`

Pass these as part of the invocation arguments.

### Seed prompt for deep-interview

The arguments passed to deep-interview become its `{{ARGUMENTS}}` — this IS the initial idea. Frame all Phase 2b context into the arguments:

```
--standard [company_name] agentic workflow readiness assessment

Pre-interview context — do not re-ask, build on this:
- Business problem: [from Phase 2b]
- Business outcome desired: [from Phase 2b]
- Cost of doing nothing: [from Phase 2b]
- Decision maker / DRI: [from Phase 2b]
- Timeline pressure: [from Phase 2b]
- Budget envelope: [from Phase 2b]
- Systems in use: [from Phase 2b]
- Org size: [from Phase 2b]
- Company research summary: [from Phase 2]
- Assessment type: [company | project]

Consultant framing: We are forward-deployed strategy consultants. The bias is hybridize first. The pilot must be a 4-6 week fixed-scope deployment. We ship working software, not slides. Ask about specific systems, specific metrics, specific workflows — not generic intentions.

The five assessment dimensions: specificity (30%), systems (25%), success (20%), risk (15%), fit (10%). Probe for closed-loop architecture (outcome signal, judge, memory, update mechanism). Classify the target tier (1-5) and reject up-tier shortcuts.

IMPORTANT — business-outcome discipline: When a client states an IT-layer problem (e.g., "fix SharePoint", "build a RAG chatbot"), do not accept it as the goal. Ask: "What business outcome does that support? What does a wrong [answer] cost?" The goal is never the tool — the goal is the dollar or time outcome the tool enables.
```

Scope: `assess_project` for project-level, `cos_onboarding` for company-level.

**If the selected runtime invocation returns an error or deep-interview is not available: hard stop. Report the error and exit. Do not proceed.**

## Phase 4: Wait for deep-interview to complete

When the selected Phase 3 invocation runs, deep-interview takes over the conversation and runs its own Socratic loop internally. This is a blocking call — you wait for it to return.

**What to expect:**
- deep-interview asks the user questions directly
- The business-outcome discipline is baked into the seed prompt passed in Phase 3
- deep-interview runs until: ambiguity ≤ 0.2, all dimensions ≥ 0.7, round 20 cap, or user exits early

**After deep-interview returns:**
- Confirm the crystallized spec was produced (saved to `{runtime_output_dir}/deep-interview-{slug}.md`)
- Read the final ambiguity score from the spec
- Proceed to Phase 5

Do not answer questions yourself during this phase. deep-interview handles the interview loop.

## Phase 5: Export to DOCX and deliver

When deep-interview returns, the crystallized spec is at `{runtime_output_dir}/deep-interview-{slug}.md`. Read it, then export directly to DOCX for client review. Do not reformat — the spec is already structured. Stop after delivery.

**Step 1 — Read the crystallized spec:**
```
Read `{runtime_output_dir}/deep-interview-{slug}.md`
```
Confirm the file exists and has content.

**Step 2 — Save the raw spec as markdown:**
```
Write to `{runtime_output_dir}/assess-{slug}.md` with the content from Step 1
```
This preserves the raw spec alongside the DOCX.

**Step 3 — Save the JSON artifact:**
```
Write to `{runtime_output_dir}/assess-{slug}.json`
```
(Extract the structured fields from the spec: company, type, dimensions, ambiguity, spec content, timestamp.)

**Step 4 — Export to DOCX:**
```bash
pandoc --version 2>/dev/null || echo "not found"
```

Pandoc was already verified in Phase 0c. Export the DOCX:
```bash
pandoc {runtime_output_dir}/assess-{slug}.md \
  -o {runtime_output_dir}/assess-{slug}.docx \
  --from=markdown \
  --toc \
  --toc-depth=2 \
  --reference-doc=default \
  --metadata title="Agentic Workflow Readiness Assessment: {company_name}" \
  --metadata author="AgentDash Consulting" \
  --metadata date="{ISO_date}" \
  2>&1 || echo "DOCX export failed"
```

If DOCX export fails, report the pandoc error and stop. Do not silently downgrade to markdown-only delivery.

**Step 5 — Present the deliverable:**
```
"Assessment complete. Your readiness report is ready:

• Markdown spec: {runtime_output_dir}/assess-{slug}.md
• Word document: {runtime_output_dir}/assess-{slug}.docx
• JSON artifact: {runtime_output_dir}/assess-{slug}.json

Share the .docx with your stakeholders for review."
```

Stop here. Do not offer to plan, execute, or refine. The deliverable is the DOCX.

</Steps>

<Tool_Usage>
- Use `WebFetch` or `Bash` with `curl` for website research
- Use `AskUserQuestion` for intake collection (structured form, not open Q&A)
- Use `Skill()` to invoke deep-interview only for OMC; use `$deep-interview` as an OMX in-session Codex skill for OMX
- Use `Read` to load the crystallized spec from deep-interview output
- Use `Write` to save markdown and JSON artifacts
- Use `Bash` with required `pandoc` for DOCX export
</Tool_Usage>

<Examples>
<Good>
Intake form presented clearly:
```
Let me assess [Acme Corp] for agentic workflow readiness.

Company: Acme Corp
URL: https://acme.com
Assessment Type: Company
```
Why good: User can see exactly what's being assessed, correct any errors before proceeding.
</Good>

<Good>
Research note before seeding:
```
[Research] Fetched acme.com — detected industry: Financial Services
Summary: Acme Corp provides B2B payment processing for mid-market retailers.
```
Why good: Provides transparency about what Claude learned before asking deep questions.
</Good>

<Good>
Closed-loop probe in interview question:
```
You mentioned the RFP responder agent will write back to Salesforce. How do you measure whether the drafted RFP was actually accepted or rejected by the sales team? What is the outcome signal that closes the loop?
```
Why good: Probes specifically for closed-loop architecture components, not just workflow description.
</Good>

<Good>
Report with clear readiness verdict:
```
## Readiness Verdict
Acme Corp has STRONG readiness for a narrow pilot (customer support deflection)
but WEAK readiness for company-wide deployment (legacy ERP integration gap, no DRI assigned).
Target a pilot scope first.
```
Why good: Actionable, specific, tells the organization what to do next.
</Good>

<Good>
Tier-downgrade rejection in report:
```
Tier 5 recommendation rejected — customer has zero agents in production.
Downgraded to Tier 3 (Workflow Runner) as the wedge that opens the path.
```
Why good: Honest assessment of organizational readiness, not just what the customer wants to hear.
</Good>

<Good>
IT-layer problem translated to business outcome:
```
Client: "We need to organize our SharePoint."
Consultant: "What business outcome is SharePoint disorganization blocking?"
Client: "Our sales team can't find technical specs, so they guess."
Consultant: "What does a wrong guess cost you per deal, and how often does it happen?"
Client: "Probably $50K missed per deal on average, maybe 20% of deals are affected."
Consultant: "That's $X per quarter in at-risk revenue. Let's solve that."
```
Why good: Never accepted the IT problem as the goal. Converted SharePoint chaos into a dollar figure on the second probe. The agentic workflow recommendation will be framed around protecting that revenue, not cleaning up SharePoint.
</Good>
</Examples>

<Escalation_And_Stop_Conditions>
- If the user declines to provide a URL, proceed with company name only (skip research phase)
- If the selected runtime's deep-interview invocation returns an error or deep-interview is unavailable: **hard stop.** Do not proceed with manual interviewing. Report the error and exit.
- If the company has no clear industry signal from the website, note "Industry: Unknown" and proceed
- Hard stop at deep-interview round 20 regardless of ambiguity
- If customer asks for Tier 5 with zero agents in production, explicitly downgrade and explain why
- If the interview captures an IT-layer problem (e.g., "fix SharePoint", "build a RAG chatbot") without a business-outcome translation, do NOT let it pass. Probe until the dollar/time cost is named
